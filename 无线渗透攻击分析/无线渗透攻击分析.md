# Wireless Penetration Attack Analysis

# Preface
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few days in the study of wireless attacks, in the process of learning to find the current wireless security is really very immature, for the utilization of wireless attacks can be said to be quite simple. Below I will analyze some of the attack process to explain, I believe that after reading this chapter you will gain.
# Preparation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let's look at the tools we need to prepare before penetration.

 - kali linux system
 - monitor network card
 - aircark-ng kit
 - mdk3 tools
 - fluxion tools

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above these preparations need to be characterized by attention to the point is that the listening card, note that in the process of purchasing a certain treasure must pay attention to the purchase of the card is not a dual-frequency, I did not pay attention to the purchase, so the purchase of a single-frequency card that is, the 2.4G version, there is no way to receive a 5G frequency band, and now the mainstream of the domestic Nowadays, mainstream home routers are basically dual-band, so if you can only attack a single band, it will usually automatically jump to another band, resulting in the inability to capture packets. The aircark-ng package is built-in in kali, mdk3 and fluxion need to be downloaded.


> apt-get install mdk3
> git clone https://github.com/FluxionNetwork/fluxion.git

# Wireless Attacks in a Nutshell
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently on the market mainstream router encryption is WPA2, is the upgraded version of WPA, the difference between them is that WPA2 use more secure encryption technology AES, so it is more difficult to crack than the WPA, but it will still be attacked. However, it can still be attacked. The test environment in this chapter is with a WPA2 encrypted router. When talking about wireless LAN, we have to mention the two interfaces of the router, LAN and WAN, as well as WLAN.

 LAN can be interpreted as a local area network (LAN), through the access to the LAN port of the device is in this LAN.
 WAN port can be understood as a wide area network, is connected to the external network interface, is external, the role is to access the network.
 WLAN is wireless LAN.
 LAN and WLAN are internal, such as computers, cell phones, TVs, etc. are accessed in this interface, and they constitute a LAN that can communicate with each other. They need to go through the router first and then forward them outward to communicate with each other.

 Here we carry out a wireless attack is to target the router, by attacking the router to cause the LAN devices can not communicate with each other or capture their communication data, here we look at the technical analysis of it.
# Listening to the network card configuration
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before penetration we need to configure the network card connected to our virtual machine, I purchased the card is the following this, in a treasure is 70 a few dollars, the signal is stronger is a pity is a single frequency.
 ! [Insert image description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328115030609.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
 After we connect the NIC to the computer, we open the virtual machine to connect the NIC.
 ! [Insert picture description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328115517759.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
 After connecting the NIC I check the status of the NIC in the terminal.
! [Insert image description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328115613540.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
We can see that the virtual machine has recognized the NIC, and below we need to switch the NIC to listen mode. Listening mode is the mode of operation in which the wireless card receives all data streams that pass through it. To do this, we use the following command.

> airmon-ng start wlan0

Here wlan0 is the name of our card, which can be seen in iwconfig.
! [Insert description of image here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328120130242.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
After executing the above commands, and then executing iwconfig we find that the name of the NIC has changed to wlan0mon which means that the NIC is in listening mode, and we can test it below.
# Information collection
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we need to scan the nearby network to get some information about the nearby wifi. This is very important to the back of the penetration, we need this step to get the information to the back of the penetration operation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the command to get a list of wireless wifi

> airodump-ng wlan0mon


! [Insert picture description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328121553212.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
**In order to protect other people's privacy, I've coded the macs of other wifi's to show only the information of the router that needs to be tested (it's the one I use in my own home). **
BSSID: mac address of the wifi.
PWR: signal level reported by the card, the lower the value the better the signal, ignore the negative sign in front.
Beacons: the number of announcements sent by the wireless
CH: Channel
MB: Maximum rate supported by the wireless
ENC: encryption algorithm system used, OPN means no encryption
CIPHER: detected encryption algorithm
AUTH: Authentication protocol used.
ESSID: wifi name
STATION: MAC address of the client, including those connected and those who want to search for wireless to connect. If the client is not connected, it will show “notassociated” under BSSID.
Rate: Indicates the transmission rate.
Lost: packets lost in the last 10 seconds.
Frames: number of packets sent by the client.
Probe: the name of the connected wifi.

**This piece of information below shows the wifi being connected, in STATION we can see the MAC of the connected wifi device, and the BASSID in front of it is the MAC of the wifi, sometimes the Probe at the back can't see the name of the wifi, but the careful partners can also compare the name of the wifi through the MAC address and the information above. Sometimes there is no way to scan the information using airodump-ng, here I often encountered in the process of testing, here I suggest that it may be worthwhile to plug and unplug the network card. **

**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we continue the following penetration through the information above it. **

# mdk3 exploit attack
 **&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MDK3 is a wireless DOS attack test tool to launch Beacon Flood, Authentication DoS, Deauthentication/Disassociation Amok and other modes of attack, in addition, it also has a hidden ESSID violence detection mode. In addition, it also has a brute force mode for hiding ESSID, 802.1X penetration testing and other functions. **.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation method article above has been said, here will not make statements. We mainly look at the verification flood attack and cancel the authentication attack which is also used more than the two attack methods.

  ## Authentication Flood Attack / Authentication Flood Attack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authentication Flood Attack, often referred to as Auth Attack, is a form of denial of service attack on wireless networks. The target of this attack is mainly for those who are in the authentication, and AP to establish an association with the associated client, the attacker will send a large number of fake authentication request frames to the AP (fake authentication services and status codes), when a large number of fake authentication requests received over the ability to withstand, the AP will be disconnected from the other wireless services connection.
**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a refers to the authentication flood attack, and -a specifies the mac of the attacking wifi. **

> mdk3 wlan0mon a -a 50:2B:73:6A:18:81

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After using the above command will send a large number of authentication information to the target AP, will soon be disconnected from other wireless connections, continue to attack the router will be stuck crash. Part of the router has an anti-DDOS function can prevent such attacks.! [insert image description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2020032812373179.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text _aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
The router becomes particularly slow in such an attack mode, and above we can see that he keeps incrementing the client requests.
## De-authentication Flood Attack
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A de-authentication flood attack, often referred to simply as a Deauth attack, is a form of denial-of-service attack on a wireless network that seeks to convert a client to an unassociated/unauthenticated state by spoofing the de-authentication frames from the AP to the client's unicast address. This form of attack is very effective and fast in interrupting client wireless services for wireless client adapter tools that are widely used today. Typically, before the attacker sends another de-authentication frame, the client station re-associates and authenticates in order to obtain service again. It takes repeated spoofing of the de-authentication frame by the attacker to cause all clients to continuously deny service.
**d is the de-authentication attack and -c is the specified channel. **

> mdk3 wlan0mon d -c  2


There is no echo during the attack, using -c to specify the channel will attack all WIFIs in channel 2, you can use -w to specify the whitelist, then it will not attack the signals in the whitelist.
! [insert image description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2020032814445329.png)
Here's a look at the effect
! [Insert image description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328144646534.jpg?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
We found that the WIFI connection was disconnected, and trying to connect again shows an incorrect password.

## aireplay-ng/deauthentication attack
aireplay-ng is also a tool in the aircark-ng suite, here is the explanation of his analysis of the de-authentication attack explained, let's take a look at the following.
** -0 to specify the attack as a de-authentication attack, 0 to send unlimited disconnected packets, specify other numbers to send the number of offline packets, -a to specify the target router mac address. **
>aireplay-ng -0 0 -a mac wlan0mon

After starting the attack it will keep sending offline packets to the target.
! [Insert description of image here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328145422466.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
During the attack, the wifi will disconnect, and if it tries to reconnect it will ask for the wifi password again, so I also think it is superior to mdk3.
! [Insert description of image here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328145645472.jpg?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
# WIFI password capture
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we are explaining the wifi password capture, the basic principle is that we listen to the specified route of the packet, during the use of Deauth attack, resulting in the wifi under the person to reconnect, so as to capture the login handshake packet for cracking.

 **Listening to the packet **
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First we need to listen to the packets of the specified channel, use the command.
 ** -c to specify the channel, -w to specify the output address, the packet starts with hello, --bssid to specify the MAC address of the AP. **
> airodump-ng -c 2 -w /root/cap/hello --bssid 50:2B:73:6A:18:81 wlan0mon

We can see that packets are constantly being received in the direction indicated by the arrow
! [Insert picture description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328150714268.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)

Now it is listening to the channel, then we perform a de-authentication attack on it and then the mobile reconnects.
! [Insert description of image here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328150942206.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
Seeing the WPA handshake appear in the direction of the arrow indicates that it has been successfully captured and we ctrl+c to stop the packet capture. You can see the packets in the directory.! [Insert image description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328152243692.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
Next we blast the packet, using the command.
** -w specify dictionary**
> aircark -w /root/number.txt /root/cap/hello-01.cap

Get the wifi password, the attack is utilized (yes, the wifi password is my number), the dictionary you can download on the Internet, theoretically, as long as the dictionary is powerful can be blasted out, there is a CTF question is the test of this tool.
! [Insert image description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328152351521.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)

# Fluxion infiltration tool
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fluxion is a wireless security testing tool, the principle of its attack is more on the side of phishing in social engineering. One of the install.sh script can quickly help you check the required plug-ins and install , you can build a complete environment in a short period of time . The new version adds support for Chinese to make it more user-friendly. Integration includes a combination of several tools explained above to make the attack more flexible and convenient. To some extent reduced the threshold of the attack on the utilization.
 ** call out different tools interface does not look very handsome? **! [Insert picture description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328153937512.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I think his attack mode is biased towards social engineering, with the above capture handshake packet blasting is different, of course, you can also choose to violently break the pattern, here the attack mode I am choosing to camouflage AP, the tool will be attacked by disconnecting the real wifi, generating a passwordless AP signal of the same name, the user connects to the automatic pop-up When the user connects to the AP, it will automatically pop up a page asking for the wifi password, and when the user enters it, it will automatically return the display information to the attacker. Of course, the password must be correct, because he will verify it and return it only if it is real.

 Here we enter the password and return to this screen.! [Insert description of image here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328154312847.jpg?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70)
 Go back to the attack machine and get the WIFI password.
 ! [Insert picture description here](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200328154336151.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10, text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3FxXzQyODA0Nzg5,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70) 
 I'm not going to explain the attack process of **fluxion, if you are interested, you can download it and learn it by yourself**.


```bash
mdk3 wlan0mon b -f a.txt -c 1 -p 200
-n is the name of the specified ap
-p specifies the packet sending rate
-a is to specify encryption as AES
-g randomly spoofs the wireless signal


mdk3 wlan0mon a -a mac -c -s 300
-c doesn't check if the test is successful or not
-s packet rate

mdk3 wlan0mon d -w whitelist -c 2
-b blacklist
-c specify channel
```

# Penetration Ideas to Share
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I propose a scenario simulation, assuming that we are in a dormitory, each dormitory has a wifi, now we use the above way to get the wifi password into the next dormitory's LAN, at this time, we can disguise the gateway through the arp spoofing, listening to other people in the dormitory access to the packet, get the cookie information, plaintext passwords and so on. So my idea after that is to make an automated script that combines the above attacks to get access information in the LAN, which is really like ARP attack, but I think it is not limited to this. The specific idea is similar to the way in WiFi Pineapple, I believe its implementation will be a very long process.
# Postscript
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wireless attacks on here, after I will send some tutorials on WiFi Pineapple, I was thinking of integrating these two paragraphs to a piece of writing, but I feel that the article will be too cumbersome, so I did not do so, the Internet is not a lot of explanations about the wireless and Pineapple Pie, so I was thinking of writing the paragraph I've been waiting for news from home for a while now. I've been waiting for news at home for the last while, so I hope it will be good news. **Finally, I wish you all the best of luck in your future endeavors. **
