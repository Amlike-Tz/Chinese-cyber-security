# Cyberspace Fingerprinting: A Critical Path for the Research and Determination of New Cybercrimes

** Author: The Wind Rises **

## Foreword

New-type cybercrime refers to a category of criminal behavior that uses computer technology and Internet platforms to carry out criminal activities. It covers a series of behaviors that use the network and digital technology to carry out illegal activities, such as ** phishing, online fraud, malware attacks, hacking, data leakage, online pornography and social network crimes ** and so on.

With the current fight against the governance of new types of cybercrime game situation gradually evolved, the case research and judgment process that the need for more efficient means of governance. Realization of ** scientific research and judgment, comprehensive governance ** the construction of new network crime prevention and control of the new system, there is an urgent need to strengthen the police research and judgment means, the introduction of innovative research and judgment technology, improve the efficiency of case handling. Thus realizing the rapid response to the detection and handling of new cases, for cybercrime cases governance **standardization, process **initiatives. At the same time, due to the complexity and transnational nature of new cybercrime, law enforcement agencies are faced with the challenge of lagging case research and judgment, and need to continuously improve their own capabilities to deal with this threat.

Cyberspace fingerprinting is the collection and analysis of digital traces and service characteristics manifested by the cyber assets involved in a case, similar to the concept of fingerprinting in traditional criminal science, where each site of cybercrime activity leaves unique characteristics in cyberspace. In this paper, we will focus on the formation and collection methods of cyberspace fingerprints, as well as their application practice in cybercrime research and judgment. At the same time, we will verify the feasibility and effectiveness of cyberspace fingerprints in researching and judging cybercrimes through actual case studies.

## Criminal Science and Technology: Behavior and the Concept of Cyber Fingerprinting

Currently, cybercrime has developed into a huge criminal ecosystem, and new types of cybercrime provide support for other traditional forms of crime, aggravating the harm of cybercrime. How to correlate the cyber assets of the organizational groups involved has become a major challenge for case investigators. In the vast majority of cases, the server sites of criminal groups are characterized by **multiple targets**, **difficulty in correlation**, and **low timeliness**. In the process of research and analysis, often the chain of clues will be scattered, forensic sites within a few days on the failure and transfer of services, can not effectively carry out the next step in the traceability of clues. In the current situation of combating new network crime criminal technology work with the network is necessary and urgent task, as the technical reconnaissance department must first improve the network technology business capacity, insight into the relevant crime means, to assist the criminal investigation, pre-trial, prosecution and other departments to do a good job of new network crime prevention and combating the work of the case.

**behavior**: different groups, may show the basic unique characteristics, when we can grasp this feature, then we can identify all the individuals in the group as far as possible, and these behavioral characteristics in the cyberspace mapping is shown in the equipment of the various ports protocols in the banner features.

At present, the fingerprint library formed by the commonly used generic component fingerprinting in cyberspace mapping makes use of the default configuration features of the generic component **behavior** for identification, but the assets involved in the case are often the targets of customized configurations, which are the main objects to be elaborated in this paper. In these customization processes different groups may show different unique characteristics, the use of these behavioral characteristics of cyberspace mapping, which is called “** behavioral mapping **”.

**Here we can understand behavior as features, and how to extract these features for more accurate matching has undoubtedly become one of the most important aspects. **

In cyberspace mapping, the concept of fingerprints and traditional criminal investigation techniques its broad ideas overlap, for example, we do the process of character portraits, for the description of a person's physical appearance, we know that the target is a large eyes, high nose, slim, tall, etc., which are the target's external characteristics, but for such characteristics is a certain degree of ambiguity, because the stand in the perspective of the entire society However, such characteristics are somewhat ambiguous because in the context of society as a whole, there are many people who also meet the above characteristics, but these are still the external characteristics of the reconnaissance target. Therefore, we need to introduce some more **"precise ‘**, **’specific ‘**, **’immutable ”** individual characteristics, which can decisively point to the asset range of a certain person or group. or gang's range of assets, characteristics that are both precise in distinguishing the target assets and specific enough not to be easily modified.

- **Cognitive
- **Characteristics
- **Fingerprint

For the concept of network asset fingerprinting, the above three points, first of all from the cognitive start, the cognition here is the research and judgment personnel in the analysis of what characteristics are useful, different people look at the problem in different ways, angles are different, so from the cognitive start to look at the nature of the event, to find out what it meets our understanding of the ** “precise” **, **"specific ‘**, **’immutable ”**, and combine them to build a fingerprint. Of course, the features here usually will not be the only one, even the traditional criminal investigation, the face of the target fingerprints also need more than one fingerprints for comparison, the same put in the network asset mapping, we need to find as much as possible the common characteristics of a certain organization for the concatenation of features, only meet the single feature is not enough to illustrate the problem, and often for the information we have collected before at the same time meet more than one feature, then it is suspicious !

! [1710159230002](. /images/1710159230002.jpg)

Assuming that the research and judgment found that the target has the common characteristics of **Nginx server, are 302 jumps, similar time, are HTTPS protocol **, etc., which is the common characteristics of the target assets, can indirectly prove that we associated with the assets is accurate. The problem of accuracy and inaccuracy is often reflected in this, just as if the people in two photos do not have the slightest resemblance, do not have similar characteristics, then the probability is that there is no cross-relationship between them. In the process of traceability, intelligence is not obtained directly by using any product or technology, but by mutual corroboration and deduction of clues obtained in multiple dimensions, so in the whole traceability system, the researchers' knowledge of technology is crucial. This is also the process of searching for target features and building fingerprints for efficient research and judgment from the cognitive perspective as mentioned above.

For the thinking of the data of the assets of the site involved in the case, in fact, more often than not, we want to sort out the target **Organizational structure**, **Subordination**, and hope to find more involved in the case of the network assets, from which the data can be extracted to be able to use for the next step of the work of the research and adjudication of the data, which is the network fingerprints need to solve the core problem. The data is there, it contains a lot of information, as to what clues can be obtained from different data information, but also depends on the research and judgment analysts for the cognition of the data, the process of traceability is also the process of aggregation of the data, often the clues are not placed there, but after careful analysis and intelligence clues between the mutual corroboration of the obtained, which is also the key to test the traceability of the ability of the personnel.

With the gradual advancement of the current process of combating cybercrime, criminal gangs have derived a number of anti-reconnaissance means, services are gradually migrated to foreign clouds, and more and more site services have begun to be de-servers through cloud storage, cloud gateway domain names and other de-servers, and through the second layer of jumping or even more layers to get to the real H5 page, and only need to be fixed to write a whitelisted cloud gateway address in the APP to avoid repeated Packing and the problem of blocking the real H5 address, which also indicates that the difficulty of traditional means of tracking through the implementation of the server address of the APP is gradually increasing. At present, to address this phenomenon, by making exclusive network fingerprints for H5 pages in the survival stage, we can effectively correlate the real crime site jumped after the whitelisted domain name, which provides a key path for the subsequent research and analysis of the real servers for adjustment.

## Case Research and Judgment from the Perspective of Cyberspace Mapping

Cyberspace mapping data is based on cyberspace assets, which are cyberspace asset data with time and space attributes. In recent years, cyberspace mapping technology has become a cutting-edge field of multidisciplinary cross-fertilization of network communication technology, cyberspace security, geography and other disciplines. **This field mainly focuses on the “holographic map ”** of cyberspace information, builds a powerful infrastructure for accurate sampling, mapping and prediction of real-time observation of the global network, and models and expresses the attributes of cyberspace resources as well as the correlation relationship among them through the use of network probing, collection, convergence, analysis and visualization, so as to realize the global cyberspace asset data with temporal and spatial attributes. By using network detection, collection, aggregation, analysis and visualization, the attributes of cyberspace resources and the correlation relationship between cyberspace resources are modeled and expressed, and the holographic digital mapping of all elements of the global cyberspace and the visual map display are realized, so as to reflect the changes in the state of the cyberspace resources and the behavior of networks.

Global cyber asset data acquisition generally relies on more professional cyberspace search engines, which carry out periodic data acquisition by deploying globalized probe nodes, and analyze, store, and establish relevant retrieval architectures through fingerprinting rules, in order to provide detailed information retrieval data. Currently, the acquisition of spatial asset data in cyberspace relies on search engines such as ZoomEye, Shodan, Censys, and BinaryEdge to accomplish this.

**The 3W problem (“What? Where? Who?”) is the basic problem to be solved for the research and determination of assets related to cyber-related cases. **

! [1710159315305] (. /images/1710159315305.jpg)

The 3W question literally means ** what is it, where is it, and to whom does it belong? ** And applied to the research and judgment of network-related cases, the current first-line investigation for the assets involved in the case of a more strict division of attribution, for the same type of highly similar cases, whether the same gang, different cases can be interrelated? All need to think and confirm the point, in this case, would rather get less information, but also to ensure accuracy. Then we first think from who and then from what and where to collect information, assets belonging to and related network information, such as the use of frameworks, deployment of business systems, services, open ports, the use of development languages, domain names and so on are as a group of assets of the common fuzzy features. Of course, whether from the point of view of case research and judgment or enterprise security operations, the first thing to determine should be the attribution of the target, if not the relevant target or their own assets, then the subsequent work is meaningless, so in the use of spatial mapping the first thing you need to do is to determine the attribution of the target, and then consider the location of the assets and other issues.

For the penetration of new types of cybercrime, the difference between conventional penetration tasks, mainly for this type of site is not the main core of the main to find out as much as possible security risks, more focused on the concept of **virtual identity **. It is worth noting that, in order to implement the virtual identity, the data of concern here more often focus on the **agent identity**, **backend administrator identity**, **victim information**, **backend login data**, **consumption of water** and other information. **In general, all the data collection is to better implement the identity information of the criminal gangs. **

In the association for a certain target, if the target site uses HTTPS protocol, then we can extract the certificate **Serial Number, Subject** and other field values for the association of assets, it is worth noting that in the SSL certificate information, often with a network fingerprint can be formed characteristics of the **special, immutable** relevant features, for example, you can Find the real IP after the CDN, or after getting a certain IP to prove its attribution, identify its DNS servers, related domain names and so on. ** in a scenario case, for example, we found a side asset and only one IP, then how to prove the ownership of the asset, it may be worthwhile to look in the certificate information, often the Subject field has clues related to the domain name, ** or like a common way to match SSL certificates will be the certificate serial number for HEX encoding, through the search engine syntax to match the way can be. The way can be. ** Conventional features extracted are favicon icon hash code, HTTPS certificate sequence number, front-end code snippet, service connection banner and so on. **Through the extraction of the target front-end JS code, which is also the most accurate way, through the understanding of the concept of different individuals for the rules, the fingerprints written to match the relevance and accuracy are different.

**The following is a list of real-world case scenarios for associating target assets. **

First of all, network probing was performed against the local network IP: 160.202.xxx.59, and the following results were obtained:

|       IP       | Port | Protocol | Service | ISP  | Country | City      | Title          | Time       |
| :------------: | ---- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ------- | --------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 160.202.xxx.59 | 443  | https    | nginx   |      | China   | Hong Kong | 优惠大厅       | 2023-07-28 |
| 160.202.xxx.59 | 8888 | http     | nginx   |      | China   | Hong Kong | Redirecting... | 2023-07-01 |
| 160.202.xxx.59 | 888  | http     | nginx   |      | China   | Hong Kong | 403 Forbidden  | 2023-06-20 |
| 160.202.xxx.59 | 21   | ftp      |         |      | China   | Hong Kong |                | 2023-05-28 |
| 160.202.xxx.59 | 80   | http     | nginx   |      | China   | Hong Kong | 404 Not Found  | 2023-04-27 |

If we find that the target IP is open to HTTPS port 443, we can check its TLS certificate information and look for associated assets, because some fields in TLS certificates usually have unique pointers, so we can use this to get more accurate network-related associated assets.

```bash
SSL Certificate
Version: TLS 1.3
CipherSuit: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
Handshake Message: x509: cannot validate certificate for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
Message: x509: cannot validate certificate for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
    Data.
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 1270793655660676xxxx2163492096409332991 (0x5f9a9875af8df76858b6aa9a065fecff)
        .........
        DNS:61654tyj.cc, DNS:tyj6165.com, DNS:www.61652yh.com, DNS:www.yh61652.com, DNS:yh46165.com, DNS:46165tyj.com........
```

It can be found that the HTTPS certificate information **Subject and X509v3 Subject Alternative Name** fields exist in the domain name information, research and judgment process, these domain name information can be used as a basic data source to do the next step in the asset association operation, so as to achieve the purpose of expanding clues. **Furthermore, the certificate serial number HEX encoding can also be used as the basis for fingerprinting for retrieval**, that is, the Serial Number field as a fingerprint for asset association, the style of the original serial number value is:

```
5f:9a:98:75:af:8d:f7:68:xx:xx:aa:9a:06:5f:ec:ff
``.

HEX encoding gives the network fingerprint as `1270793655660676xxxx2163492096409332991`. The fingerprint formed by the serial number can be aggregated and correlated with the network assets using the same TLS certificate in the large network data, and the subsequent researchers and judges can further judge the attribution of the assets based on the correlation of the data, which can be used as the basis for expanding the line to provide more clues for the implementation of the virtual identities of the persons involved in the case.

Through the network fingerprints formed by the researchers and adjudicators based on the characteristics of the target, it is possible to conduct an inventory of the sites deployed by the closed servers. Although these sites have been closed or transferred to the service due to the timeliness of the case, the researchers and adjudicators can still restore the target assets through the mapping data collected in the past and the history of the open service situation, so as to **associate the assets, and restore the assets involved in the case **assets situation.

``javascript
if (regx.test(actuser)) {
	layer.msg('Member account is incorrect, can't enter special symbols or spaces!' , {
		icon: 2,
		time: 1000
	}); }
        return false; }
}

$.ajax({
	url: '/addons/active/index/saveuser.html',
	type: 'post', }
	data: {
		actuser: actuser,
		form: form, captcha: captcha, captcha, captcha, captcha, captcha, captcha
		captcha: captcha,
		act_id: this.act_id ? this.act_id : act_id,
		token: 'bcbde5498bd1cf03474b80f950d5cb49',
	}
})
```

The above figure shows the JS front-end code snippet of the target server assets involved in the case, here extracting `url: '/addons/active/index/saveuser.html'` as a fingerprint match, it can be found that most of the assets are IDC servers in China, with the IP belonging to Hong Kong, titled Discount Lobby, and with the ISP Shenzhen Katherine, middleware is nginx and other similar features. **DaNet mapping results totaling 133 records**, to verify the accuracy, by accessing the resultant IP address found that the same code snippet exists in its front-end page and is identical to other sites, so it can be judged that the site is the same template as the initial site, and the deployed servers are highly similar in characteristics.

Continuing to add code snippet features to the above features for constructing web asset fingerprints, which in turn yields the following results.

**DaNet mapping results total 94 records**, through the above example we can learn that in the process of constructing fingerprints, based on the extraction of features as a condition of the increase in the number of relevant assets need to comply with the characteristics of more, here intercepted two front-end code, found that in the case of a single feature of the data results of 133 records, multi-feature matching results of 94, indicating that multi-conditional matching under the accuracy will be more higher, more in line with our requirements for the matching degree of associated assets! Here can not only be a combination of front-end code, you can also use the banner information, port information, ISP and other information combinations, according to the understanding of the organization's features can be written fingerprints, can be effectively associated with the site in question, but everyone based on their own knowledge of the fingerprints associated with the degree of may be different, but also based on the degree of understanding of fingerprints decided by the different personnel to identify The most important part of fingerprinting is to identify what are the valuable features. **In short, knowledge of the data is important**.

In addition to the front-end code as a fingerprint for association, can also be set through the site favicon icon as the associated fingerprints, here to a fake government website case to start the discussion, the target used the national emblem style icon as the site favicon icon, but the icon has been modified by the network developers, with the uniqueness, so through the favicon icons and Therefore, by using the favicon icon and encoding it with mmh3 as a web fingerprint, we can accurately correlate all the sites on the web that use the forged icon.

Favicon fingerprint: `iconhash:19675xxx9909`.

The association of fingerprinting via the favicon icon style is shown above as a total of 93 results. From the update time it is also not difficult to see that the gang has been doing this business from an earlier time. And most of the servers in the Hong Kong area, IDC is not a mainstream large-scale cloud servers, it is more difficult to extract the server image, and the target middleware services are Microsoft IIS httpd, you can see that the deployment of assets involved in the network has a certain degree of similarity, it is inferred that the fake government website template has a maintenance team for its batch ** development, maintenance ** servers. You can see that some of the servers also use HTTPS protocol, then we can use TLS certificates as a network fingerprinting way to match the depth of correlation information,** thus the gang of forged government website related server sites in one net. **

[^ In order for readers to more clearly see the relevance of the assets involved, the results of the above mapping data are partially excerpted]. : 

Dynamic mapping can be realized based on network fingerprinting in order to realize continuous monitoring of new network-related assets in the course of case investigation. ** For the concept of dynamic mapping, a simple understanding of the data subscription **, here you can subscribe to the fingerprint, periodic scanning of an asset surface, so that we can dynamically grasp the cycle of the new network assets involved in the case. Often criminal investigation game is to compete in the information collection, the more clues collected for the detection of the case has a decisive role. The case of research and judgment is often lagging behind, if you can continue to monitor the target group's new online assets through dynamic mapping in advance, then also has the initiative. Dynamic mapping applied to the anti-fraud work, the face of the use of the same site framework, only change the site content and rapid transfer of the server can be tightly tracked, ** dynamic mapping of the core foundation is the network fingerprint **, to determine the asset interval, periodic scanning, through dynamic mapping observed within a certain time period of the new network assets, so as to determine that the gang is ready to implement next The new site of the crime and its activity intention, restore the entire case of fraud network mind map,** based on the concept of “dynamic mapping”, can be analyzed and interpreted for low-frequency mapping data, to refine to obtain more knowledge in different dimensions. Low-frequency mapping data, suitable for events of longer duration and longer span of time analysis needs, ** this better for ** early warning, research and judgment ** work to provide the intelligence base, to achieve the purpose of prior prevention, after the incident response.

## Forming a research and judgment framework for mapping assets involved in a case based on network fingerprints

Based on the discussion of the above business research and adjudication scenarios, it can be concluded that in the entire clue collection process, the most important thing is the aggregation of digital clues, and the data visualization of clues with retrospective value, so as to be able to clearly analyze the situation of assets involved in the case. From the point of view of weaponization, many general direction is the combination of front-line empirics and technical research, which should be interdependent relationship, for the fight against black and gray business scenarios to do is not only for a particular case, but in the face of a certain type of cybercrime model can be fast, effective response to the research and judgment, the previous experience precipitation into the land into an efficient ability to research and judgment.

The company has a lot of experience in the field of cybercrime. [1710159397700](. /images/1710159397700.jpg)

**In the face of the pain point problem of the current case study and judgment, the specific needs of the following points:**

- Sort out and manage case-related assets, associated with case-related public numbers, small programs, APP malls, similar assets, threat intelligence, etc.
- 7x24 hours real-time monitoring of changes in the server involved in the case - data subscription
- Generate service fingerprints of assets involved in the case, merge and correlate similar sites based on mapping data across the network, so as to discover hidden and marginal assets involved in the case of the target organization, thus providing clues to breakthroughs in the investigation of the case.
- Identify the nature of target assets, identify cloud assets, CDN assets, overseas assets, routers, etc.
- Effective correlation of the organizational structure and personnel relationship of the domestic companies involved in the case, facilitating the rapid completion of the research and adjudication personnel's work in the preliminary clue collection stage, thus providing effective assistance for the subsequent research and adjudication.
- High-precision location of the IP address involved in the case (enterprise leased line class, data center class, home broadband class, mobile network class, other types), through the IP data service can be intelligence analysis and risk traceability.
- Rapid vulnerability response update 0day/1day, thus efficiently realizing automated penetration of case-related services, empowering case research and judgment, and reducing the time cost of police research and judgment.
- Police personnel in the platform for a case for collaborative research and judgment, unified work progress.
- According to different cases, it provides data visualization **"New type of cybercrime combat comprehensive posture supervision big screen ”**, which provides research and judgment personnel and commanders with clearer progress of case investigation, and provides assistance for the development of the next combat strategy.

The emergence of new cybercrime has its own special background of the times, as a form of both special and common crimes, it has different characteristics from traditional criminal behavior. The current cybercrime has developed into a huge criminal ecosystem, and the new cybercrime provides support for other cybercrimes and aggravates the harm of cybercrime. With the gradual evolution of the game situation between the two sides of this type of crime, the case research and judgment process that requires more effective means of governance, so as to achieve the scientific research and judgment, comprehensive governance to build a new network crime prevention and control system of the vision, only for the target assets and the data involved in the multi-dimensional analysis, the extraction of valuable data, in order to take advantage of the fierce fight against cybercrime confrontation, and to further expand the results of the war. In the face of such a situation, the public security team urgently needs to strengthen the means of research and judgment of police officers, improve the efficiency of case investigation, achieve rapid response, and standardize the governance of cybercrime cases.

Based on the cyberspace fingerprint formation of network assets mapping research and judgment framework applied to combat new cybercrime should solve the main problems, aimed at research and judgment personnel concerned with the traceability value of the clues to the aggregation, visualization of the display to the combat center, the target belongs to the establishment of a link between the different data, automated realization of the case of the research and judgment process of the collection of basic information, balanced on the research and judgment of the personnel reconnaissance ability requirements, It balances the requirements for research and adjudication personnel's reconnaissance ability and time cost, provides effective assistance for the professional construction of police teams, and realizes the needs of process and standardization of cases.

## Postscript

In this paper, cyberspace fingerprints are discussed in depth, and by analyzing the formation of network fingerprints and capturing cases involving assets, we deeply realize that in today's fight against cybercrime, this type of case presents a more complex and hidden trend, and criminal investigation research and adjudication personnel need to use the traditional criminal investigation thinking and modern network research and adjudication technology combined with each other in order to achieve efficient correlation of the network assets involved in the case in response to the ever-changing threat. Changing threats.
