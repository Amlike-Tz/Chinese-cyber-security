## Preface

Hello, I'm wind up, I believe that before a lot of partners have learned about ** “C2 facilities front traffic control technology” **, this share is based on the RedGuard implementation of the C2 traffic advanced concealment techniques, the specific implementation is also based on the process of punching the point, when has been obtained to the edge of the host permissions and as a node thus realizing the hidden with the intranet hosts The specific implementation is also based on the process of punting, when the edge host has obtained the rights and as a node to achieve with the intranet host to conceal the traffic interaction, while giving the domain front, traffic control, sandbox analysis to avoid the effect. By customizing the domain name of the intranet host interaction, while the edge host uses the domain front CDN node interaction. The asymmetry of interaction information between the two hosts is achieved, making traceability more difficult and difficult to troubleshoot.

**This article is an extension of the C2 front traffic control technology skills, so the main effect is also from the point of view of the realization and thinking, the following I will focus on the process of technical realization to explain and analyze the relevant excellence of the skills. 


## Technical realization

In the attack and defense confrontation scenarios, most of the current unit network is still border defense, here we think about a scenario is when the external server in the DMZ area in the normal business environment, often configured with the relevant access policy, when the edge of the external servers can enter and exit the network but can not directly access the intranet hosts, the intranet PC or related server does not directly access the public network, but can access the business servers in the DMZ area, then I can edge node hosts as a RG node, the intranet online traffic relay to our C2 facilities, does not sound like a regular agent relay on the line is very similar? However, this is only a form of presentation of the skill realization, more TIPS we continue to look down.

When we take down an edge host in the middle of a hit, assuming we've taken over shell access, we deploy RG on this server as our front node** (in real-world scenarios, the configuration files are written to death in the program, even combining the Trojan and RG into the same program)**.

** The configuration file is as follows:**

Specific implementation of the relevant configuration of our main focus on the arrow pointing to the place can be, ** above the arrow 1 for the intranet hosts and edge node interaction HOST domain name **, here it is recommended that according to the specific scenarios of the target unit to set up the relevant intranet domain name, imagine the intranet in the two hosts on the intranet domain name of the traffic interactions, BT has no gumption to cut off the interaction of the traffic directly, of course, if they are able to determine is a malicious interaction traffic. If they can determine that the traffic is malicious, then BT will be able to cut off the traffic. **Arrow 2 refers to the regular domain front setup**, this a key-value pairs, the key corresponds to the HOST on the line and the value corresponds to the address of the proxy, here we can set up any use of the same CDN vendors can be used for HTTPS domain name ** (CDN node IP can be remembered to bring the http(s):// protocol can be) **.

EdgeHost is the domain name used by our cloud service vendor's domain front, that is, the domain name used by the RG edge node to interact with C2 through the CDN node, yes, RG will modify the HOST domain name of the legitimate request and modify it to the CDN domain name of the cloud service that can communicate normally.

EdgeTarget is the domain name for the intranet interaction, the same as arrow 1 needs to be the same, also only the traffic requested by the HOST for the domain name set here will be considered legitimate and RG will further modify it to the cloud service CDN domain name and thus subsequent communication.

**Here we summarize:**

is the interaction between the edge node and the host of the intranet that is through the set intranet domain name, when the Trojan horse initiates a request to the edge node of the RG, it will determine whether the request traffic HOST for the configuration file set in the intranet domain name, if it meets the RG will be considered legitimate RG will be modified for the HOST EdgeHost set up by the cloud service vendors CDN domain name for the subsequent communication of the traffic will be relayed to the C2 server, the entire link is fully hidden. The entire link is fully hidden and highly obfuscated. Imagine, the intranet domain name and the edge node interact with the intranet domain name, but the edge node further changes the actual interaction of the proxy address and the interaction of the HOST, so as to achieve the asymmetry of the interaction information between the two hosts, so that the traceability of the information is more difficult to trace, and difficult to investigate.

**The edge node interacts with the intranet hosts as shown in the figure above**.

Another advantage of this approach is that for the cloud sandbox environment, since our interaction IPs are customized to the intranet, it is not possible for the sandbox to perform connectivity correlation analysis against the intranet IPs during analysis.

One thing to keep in mind when configuring is that the HOST for the Trojan request should be:

- **HOST: Intranet domain name (as set in the RG configuration file)
- **IP: Intranet IP of the edge host **
- **Online port: 443 (matches the RG configuration file http(s) listening port)
- **Listening port: the port on which C2 is actually online**

C2 listener settings are as follows:

As opposed to the request the HOST of the C2 listener should be the cloud service vendor CDN domain, as long as the final traffic can be relayed to the C2 server.

Intranet node interaction traffic, the following figure can be seen normal to the DMZ region of the intranet IP access to port 443, intranet servers or PCs with the DMZ region of the business system has a connection is not surprising, right.

Edge host interaction traffic as shown in the figure, the actual scenario will not have a large number of TIME_WAIT, here because in order to test I set the heartbeat packet sleep to 0, the actual combat scenario to set a larger heartbeat packet jitter as well as sleep time is more secure. And I personally think that the real-world scenarios do not use HTTP traffic, explicit traffic this is not to give the sense of state for nothing haha? So generally this port is not open, we will change the RG file name to Tomcat, Apache, Nginx and so on to make its interaction look more confusing.

! [image-20220811114119723](. /images/2d703582e313f535c6c4f48b922bed8.jpg)

Speaking of heartbeat packet jitter versus sleep time, set the following field directly in the Malleable C2 Profile file.

```bash
set sleeptime “3000”;
set jitter “20”;
```

If you don't set it, there may be abnormal heartbeat packet alarms, of course, in most cases, the researchers will think it is a false alarm and thus ignore it, but to be safe, it is recommended to configure it so that it won't cause abnormal heartbeat packet alarms, which was tested by the 360 NDR device, and the specific results are as follows:

And for HTTPS traffic, any traffic monitoring device on the market is unable to review the traffic, the current monitoring device is essentially sensitive word matching, and even a manufacturer device packet inspection of the competition, the requirement to use plaintext packets, can not help but let a person doubt that in the real-world scenarios really will have RT with plaintext traffic interaction?

In addition to the interaction information asymmetry mentioned above, the biggest benefit of this approach is that the RG node is placed to the edge node thus realizing the front flow control, thus giving the same functional effect as the regular RG.

- **The defense party in the attack and defense exercise traces back the analysis of the C2 interaction traffic according to the situational awareness platform**.
- **Prevent malicious analysis of Trojan horse samples in cloud sandbox environment according to JA3 fingerprint library identification
- **Blocking malicious requests to implement replay attacks to achieve the effect of obfuscating the on-line **.
- **White-listing to restrict access to interactive traffic requests when the IP of the upload server is clearly identified
- **Prevents cyberspace mapping techniques from targeting C2 facilities for scanning identification and redirects or intercepts traffic from scanning probes
- **Support for multiple C2 server front traffic control, and can realize the effect of domain front to achieve load balancing on the line to achieve the effect of stealth **
- **Able to request IP counter-checking API interface for geographic host on-line restrictions based on IP address attribution** **Able to request IP counter-checking API interface for geographic host on-line restrictions based on IP address attribution
- ** without changing the source code, to solve the phased checksum8 rule path resolution of the existence of strong features. **
- **Analyze blue team traceability behavior through intercept logs of target requests, which can be used to track peer-to-peer connection events/issues **
- **With customizable settings for the time period of legitimate interactions of samples to enable traffic interactions only during working hours**
- **Malleable C2 Profile parser capable of validating inbound HTTP/S requests against malleable profiles and discarding outbound packets in the event of a violation (supports Malleable Profiles 4.0+)
- **Built-in blacklist of IPV4 addresses for a large number of appliances, honeypots, and cloud sandboxes associated with security vendors, enabling automatic interception of redirected request traffic
- **Can circumvent the fixed characteristics of tool traffic by customizing the SSL certificate information and redirect URLs that the tool interacts with samples** **Customize the SSL certificate information and redirect URLs that the tool interacts with samples
- **.......... **

The back node of the RG node becomes a CDN node forwarded to the C2 server, the conventional scenario of the domain front are as the first layer of the request node, and the edge host on-line is placed after the RG to realize the on-line, the DMZ region of the business system and the public network CDN IP interaction seems to be so harmonious. In this process, the intranet hosts as well as the edge hosts are not directly interacting with our C2, which is where the elegance of this advanced cloaking technique lies.

** Of course, in addition to the above mentioned better than netsh, iptables proxy transit on the line factors, easy configuration and there is no configuration record is also one of the advantages. **This is the first time I've seen this.

## Postscript

It's been a long time since I've written a postscript, so I thought I'd write about some of my plans for the rest of the year. This article will probably be my last for the next year, after which I'll probably take a short break to chase some things I really need to do, and I'd like to thank some of my regular readers for their continued interest.

Yes, I'm 20 years old and have been in the security community for a few years now, and have been occasionally active as well. Been running into a lot of interesting masters, even if HW ran into a few mealies this year hahaha? Of course, I have always said, out of the work environment, the good guys are always much less than the bad guys, and to this day still ate a lot of losses, I also found that I have not been when the first internship on the work of passionate and hot heart, I am a very easy to compromise their own people, so even if I'm still learning new things, and strive to improve their own progress, I think it's more of a state of mind to deal with things that are not so hot. I think it's more of a state of mind where I don't approach things with the same level of enthusiasm. So what I mean by withdrawing from the circle may not only leave the field of vision to continue to study, I will put down the technology for a year, peace of mind to review, may be when I come back again I should really determine the direction of their own future, for a certain direction to focus on the study of it.

**I look forward to meeting you all again in a year's time, and continuing to share the security technologies I've been studying. ** I look forward to meeting you all again in a year's time and continue to share the security technologies I have been studying.
