## Spatial Mapping Technology Ideas

** Cyberspace mapping is a concept that appeared in 2016, which mainly refers to a method of using some technical methods to detect the distribution of nodes and the index of network relations on the global Internet space, and to construct a global Internet map. [Baidu Encyclopedia]**

Surveying and mapping is actually a geographic information-related professional discipline, targeting the inventory of geographic information in the sea, on land, and in the sky. The same applies to cyberspace , so does the discovery of unknown, vulnerable assets, more like a map of cyberspace, which is used to comprehensively describe and demonstrate the cyberspace assets, the elements of cyberspace and the relationship between the elements, as well as the mapping relationship between cyberspace and real space.

**Application Scenarios:**

- Forgotten, isolated assets within the enterprise are identified and added to security management.
- Exposed assets outside the enterprise are quickly identified and counted.
- Red and blue confrontation related needs use, batch checking of captured IP.
- Batch collection of vulnerable assets (0day/1day) devices, terminals within the impact.
- Rapidly collect and merge information on new cybercrime-related sites for more efficient research and analysis.
- Statistics and replication of vulnerable assets on the Internet that are affected by related vulnerabilities.

**The 3W problem (“What? Where? Who?”) is the basic problem to be solved by cyberspace mapping. ** Literally also means **What, Where, Who? ** And applied to the red team, at present, all levels of protection network for the assets belonging to the division is actually more strict, such as assets belonging to the total group or secondary units or subsidiaries, whether or not with the group intranet interoperability? All are points that need to be thought about and confirmed. Then we first from who to think and then from what who and where in where to collect, assets belonging to the unit and related network information, such as the use of frameworks, deployment of business systems, services, open ports, the use of development languages, domain names and so on.

Of course, whether it is a red team attack and defense or trail tracing or security operations, the first thing to determine should be the attribution of the target, if not the relevant target or their own assets, then the subsequent work to carry out is meaningless, so in the use of spatial mapping the first thing you need to do is to determine the target's attribution, and then consider the assets are located in the location and the what.

After understanding the 3W's, we move on to the three main concepts of cyberspace mapping: **behavioral mapping, dynamic mapping, and cross-mapping**.

## Behavioral Mapping

**Different groups of people may exhibit basic unique characteristics, when we can get hold of this characteristic, then we can identify all the individuals in the group as far as possible, and these so-called behavioral characteristics in the cyberspace mapping is shown in the banner characteristics of each port protocol of this device. **The fingerprint library formed by the fingerprinting of common components commonly used in cyberspace mapping is to make use of the “behavior” of the common default configuration of common components, which obviously makes full use of the “laziness” of human beings. Obviously, this makes full use of the human “laziness” that is caused by the “behavior” of the generic default configuration for mapping, but also ignores the goals of those who carry out custom configurations, which are the main object of this paper.

In these customization processes, different groups may show different unique characteristics, we use these behavioral characteristics of cyberspace mapping, which is called “** behavioral mapping **”. Through practical experience “behavioral mapping” in the field of threat intelligence, national infrastructure mapping, APT/botnet/blackmail and other organizations mapping on the huge application space and shocking effect. SuperHei quotes] **P.S. Maybe he prefers to be called Hegel a little 23333**.

Here we can also understand the behavior as features, and how to extract these features for more accurate matching has undoubtedly become one of the most important aspects.

In the association for a certain target, if the target site uses HTTPS protocol, then we can extract the certificate **Serial Number, Subject** and other field values for the association of assets, it is worth noting that in the SSL certificate information, there are often a number of surprises, for example, you can look for the real IP after the CDN Or after getting a certain IP to prove its attribution, identify its DNS servers, related domain names and so on. ** to cite a scenario case, for example, we find an edge in the mining SRC assets and only one IP, then how to prove the ownership of its assets, you may wish to look in the certificate information, often Subject field has a domain name of the relevant clues. ** or like the common SSL certificate matching method will be the certificate serial number HEX encoding, through the search engine syntax (**cert/ssl**) to match the way can be.

The behavior here, more often reflected in the banner information, such as front-end code, service connection interaction information, SSL certificate information and so on.

Here is an example of a Log4j2 RCE affected *Apache* *CAS* host.

! [1](. /images/2.png)

Extract the code '<body id=“cas”>' by comparing different *Apache* *CAS* sites and looking for common features.

! [1](. /images/3.png)

It was found that a total of 16,155 results were matched, removing the features of the CAS keywords, which can also be verified by trying to attack Log4j2, but there may still be a probability of false positives through only one piece of code, so we continued to look for common features, which are the features of the framework.

! [1](. /images/4.png)

Continuing to extract features based on the code snippet extracted above, doing and arithmetic logic, the final constructed Apache CAS fingerprint is:

```
'<body id=“cas”>' + '<section class=“row”>' + '<meta charset=“UTF-8”/>'
```

That is to say, its front-end code should be consistent with the simultaneous existence of the above three pieces of code in order to match, found that this time a total of 6,248 matches to the number of the reduction, with the increase in the number of conditions associated with our fingerprints, the accuracy will be improved, so that we get the results more close to the real. The concept of fingerprinting will be explained in detail below, the use of intercepted snippets of code or their annotations have a very good effect in the association of the target using the same framework of the site.

In addition to some basic features, we can also search by some **"interesting ”** fingerprints

As in the above figure, I believe we know all understand, when we look for the real IP after the CDN, we can scan the target's ssh-hostkey by nmap and extract for matching, because no matter how many layers of CDN set, his ssh-hostkey when connecting to the ssh will not change, so we can retrieve through this fingerprinting it is possible to So we can use this fingerprinting to find the real IP address, of course, this idea is only a guideline.

The favicon icon on the website can also be used as one of the behaviors of the target organization, in HW or associated spinach sites often have unexpected results, but it should be noted that, for the use of the favicon to calculate the hash associated with the gangs of the way, there may be a certain degree of inaccuracy, if the certificate, the front-end extraction of the code of these ways to allow us to accurately locate the target Let us very accurately locate the target, then in the whole network someone to take someone else's favicon icon as their own website's icon, the public network scanning there may be false alarms, scanning out the ico icon hash is the same. However, boredom with other people's icons is always a minority, is not common, just this possibility, so we need to pay attention to, trace the clues sometimes there is no fixed formula, not through what methods will be accurate, still need to confirm the evidence.

## Dynamic mapping

** For the concept of dynamic mapping, a simple understanding of the data subscription **, here you can subscribe to a fingerprint statement or IP subscription, periodic scanning of an asset surface, so that we can dynamically grasp the situation of the new assets in the cycle, and dynamic mapping is often applied to enterprise security management or anti-fraud work. In enterprise security, dynamic mapping is used to discover newly launched business systems and add them to security management in a timely manner. Because for some of the more mature business systems, will not frequently change the site of external services, generally only modify the content of the release, etc., so when the site is online new services are worth noting.

Often offensive and defensive sides of the game than the competition is the collection of information, who collects more assets on the surface has a decisive role, some ** isolated, marginalized ** assets of the enterprise on-line did not join the security protection in a timely manner and was found by the attackers, faced with the possibility of falling, the same red team in the attack, in the technical level of the difference is not too big time, and often collects the assets is the decision to decide whether or not to breach the target.

Applied to the work of anti-fraud, you can continue to pay attention to the relevant assets of the target group through dynamic mapping, do clues. Often, targets that use the same framework and only change the content of the website to quickly transfer servers can be closely tracked. Through the dynamic mapping observed daily new assets, to determine the next step of the gang is ready to implement the main site of the crime and its intention.

It is worth mentioning that ZoomEye has come online with a very meaningful feature, which is the support of data update function in public network mapping, enabling us to update the targets to be scanned at any time. It should be noted that all spatial mapping platforms are essentially scanning behaviors of assets across the network through probe nodes around the clock, and the scanning has a certain time cycle, the data update function does not need to passively wait for the probe nodes to scan to our targets as in the past.

When the scanning is finished, an email will be sent to our mailbox, and the updated data can be quickly synchronized in kunyu.

## Cross-mapping

That's the **IPv4 and IPv6 “crossover ”**. With the country's transformation of IPv6 regulations are bound to accelerate the popularization of IPv6, on the current situation, IPV6 in the gradual popularization, but the reason why the cross-mapping here mentioned IPV6, is because, with our closely related to the security level, often appear in the IPV4 and IPV6 ** misconfiguration **, for example, the enterprise in the deployment of security measures, to its IPV4 playing full protection, but IPV6 is whiteboard. But IPV6 is a blank slate, then at this point if the attacker through the IPV6 attack, then undoubtedly a horse, which is a lot of enterprises in the conduct of security management did not think of the problem. Often it will lead to big problems, so standing in the attacker's point of view, I think it may be worthwhile to cross look at the problem. Domain names and IPV4, IPV4 and IPV6's, darknet and IPv4 。。。。 It's important to look at the data in the spirit of cross-thinking, whether it's traceability or attack, to dig for hidden clues.

And these results we found that it has common characteristics for the Nginx server, are 302 jumps, similar time, are HTTPS protocols, etc., which is also the characteristics of its target gangs in this performance, but also indirectly confirm that we are associated with the right assets. The problem of accuracy and inaccuracy is often reflected in this, just like if two photos of people do not have the slightest resemblance, do not have the same point, then the probability that they are not related.

## The concept of fingerprinting for network mapping

In network mapping, the concept of fingerprints is more interesting, and traditional criminal investigation techniques its broad ideas are overlapping, for example, we do character portraits, for a person's external physical description, for example, we know that the target is a large eyes, high nose bridge, slim body, height 180cm ..... These are the target's external characteristics, but for such characteristics is a certain degree of ambiguity, because standing in the perspective of the whole world, the same meet these characteristics of people still abound, but these are still the characteristics of our reconnaissance target, so then we have to introduce some more ** “accurate” **, ** “specific “**, **” irrevocable ”** characteristics that can be pointed directly and decisively to the range of assets of a person or group. So what are the characteristics that can decisively point to? ** ID cards, bank cards, cell phone numbers, DNA information, pupil identification ** and so on, both to accurately distinguish between the target assets but also to have the characteristics of specificity, can not be easily modified.

- Cognitive
- Characteristics
- Fingerprint

For the concept of fingerprints, put forward the above three points, first of all, should start from the cognitive, the cognitive is also said here that the research and judgment personnel in the analysis of what characteristics are useful, different people look at the problem of the way, the angle are different, so from the cognitive point of view of the nature of the event, to find out what it is consistent with our understanding of the ** “precision” **, ** “specificity **"Precision ‘**, **’Specificity ‘**, **’Immutability ”**, and combine them to build a fingerprint. Of course, the features here usually will not be the only one, even the traditional criminal investigation, the face of the target fingerprints also need more than one fingerprints for comparison, the same put in the network asset mapping, we need to find as much as possible to the common characteristics of a certain organization has a combination of features that only meet the single feature is not enough to explain the problem, often for the intelligence we have collected before to meet more than one feature, then it has a suspicious nature.

Often in the process of traceability, intelligence is not obtained directly by using any product or technology, but through multiple dimensions of the clues obtained by mutual corroboration, deduction, so in the whole traceability system, I think the research and judgment personnel's knowledge of the technology is crucial. This is also what I said at the beginning of the cognitive start, looking for target features, constructing fingerprints and thus efficient research and judgment of such a process.

For example, we found a POC of Telnet unauthorized RCE in exploit-db.

According to the arrow, extracted a feature, fingerprint feature: goke login:, match can be seen in the results of 423, through the protocol and Service, Port and these fields are very similar to the characteristics of the performance, accurate or not often reflected in this.

! [1](. /images/14.png)

 	Continue to add a condition that requires the target port to be 23, and found that the number of entries matched was 422, and found that the number of entries decreased, indicating that in the first match just now, there were some knots

Of course, in addition to being able to associate a match to the target's fingerprint, we can add other conditions that meet our requirements, for example, we can limit the output to the time, geographic country, city, etc. that the results are scanned to.

## Postscript.

**We should give data a soul, not just recognize it, what we can do with it and what we can achieve depends on how well the solution is perceived** **We should give data a soul, not just recognize it.

Thank you for your support, now it is 2022, looking back on the first time to go out to venture into the scene is still vivid in my mind, this year I have also been 20 years old, gradually age is no longer my advantage. Thinking back on this way or quite emotional, for the wild origin, then I was able to stick down probably has a force of unconvincing. Although now is not a big brother, but every day than yesterday to improve a little bit, every year than last year on a higher level for me and said it is the biggest comfort, so that I always understand that I am still on this road forward.

In the new year, I hope that everything I think will be as I wish, and everything I do will be profitable.
